TLDR: Go straight to the [mind map](https://carlgogo.github.io/AI4G_mindmap/)

Humanity is reaching an inflection point in terms of its technological development. At the same time, we are reevaluating our place on Earth and rethinking how to build a fairer society. Can artificial intelligence (AI, machine learning, statistical learning or however you want to call it) serve to tackle societal and environmental challenges? Yes, absolutely. In fact, the same algorithms used to recommend products on an e-commerce website, or choose the ads shown to you, can be used to solve real human problems. All data scientists, from aspiring ones to researchers, have the opportunity (and even the responsibility) to take advantage of the current data revolution for improving our world.

But let's be clear, this is a complex endeavour. It requires cross-disciplinary and multi-sector collaborations involving governments, NGOs, private organizations and academia. Otherwise, it will be too easy to fall for the AI hype instead of understanding it as a tool to augment our abilities. Only solutions backed up by research and deep understanding of the respective problem domain will be robust (remember the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)) and effective.

Is academic research the only way to use AI for good? How can we as data scientists help? My initial impulse was to browse the web and look for existing initiatives. This browsing-the-web exercise took a few weeks and became more serious than initially planned. It is encouraging to have found there are many caring people and initiatives related in some or other way to the *Data Science and AI for good* movement. Then it became clear that I had to share this information in an effective manner.

Mind maps are powerful tools for knowledge management and sharing. I use them all the time and decided to create one for this topic. The *Data Science and AI for good* mind map gives an overview of the initiatives around the world, including organizations, conferences, fellowships and bootcamps, data challenges, and even seed funding opportunities for startups. This mind map is powered by two amazing pieces of open source software: the [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) and its [TiddlyMap](http://tiddlymap.org/) extension. The TiddlyWiki + TiddlyMap combo allows the creation of interactive wikis in JavaScript with integrated concept maps. Moreover, the application can be used as a single HTML file which can be conveniently hosted on GitHub pages.

There will be a resource for everyone, regardless of what stage of your career you are in or the amount of time you are willing to commit. For instance, if you are looking for inspiration and interesting reads, go to the root node. Explore the *challenges* node if you are interested in individual projects you could work on during your weekends (the best way to improve your data skills!). The *bootcamps and fellowships* section is for students eager to learn data science while working on projects with social impact. Check out the *events* node for information on academic conferences and meetups. The *initiatives* section list communities, multi-sector networks and other efforts that aim to address the world's challenges with AI. If you look for volunteering or consulting opportunities, check the *organizations* section. Finally, the *entrepreneurship* node lists grant opportunities for AI/tech startups working on social good or pro-environmental causes.

Without further ado, the *Data Science and AI for good* mind map can be found [here](https://carlgogo.github.io/AI4G_mindmap/). On the right panel you will find the map itself (*Map* tab) and on the left the content associated to each node/topic. Open a node by double clicking it. The *Live* tab provides a different and less cluttered view of the map so you might find it easier to navigate. I hope this mind map will motivate and serve as a reference to those who wish to make data and technology serve the common good. If you know of any resources that deserve to be added, please reach out via email or by using the [issues section](https://github.com/carlgogo/AI4G_mindmap/issues) of the GitHub repository.

PS: A similar TW+TM web application is being prepared with a larger mind map exploring the landscape of AI and data science, full of free and valuable resources. Stay tuned!

### Supervised detection of exoplanets (2017, A&A)
We reformulate the exoplanet detection task (for [angular differential imaging](https://vimeo.com/125547220) sequences) building on well-established machine learning techniques to take high-contrast imaing post-processing from an unsupervised to a supervised learning context. In this new framework, we presented algorithmic solutions using two different discriminative models: SODIRF (random forests) and SODINN (neural networks). The proposed supervised detection framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in the task of discriminating planet signal from speckles. For instance, SODINN improves the true positive rate by a factor ranging from ∼2 to ∼10 wrt. low-rank based approaches, working at the same false positive rate.

### VIP (2017, AJ)
The Vortex Image Processing (VIP) library is a python package dedicated to astronomical high-contrast imaging. It relies on the extensive python stack of scientific libraries and aims to provide a flexible framework for high-contrast data and image processing. [ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06184).

### LLSG (2016, A&A)
Inspired by recent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we proposed the Low-rank plus Sparse plus Gaussian noise (LLSG) decomposition of [angular differential imaging](https://vimeo.com/125547220) sequences. [ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08381).

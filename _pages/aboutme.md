I hold a master's degree in Data Science & Big Data from  [INTERNATIONAL DATA SCIENCE INSTITUTE](https://datascience.inphb.ci/vues/datascience) where its partnerships are [ENSEA](https://ensea.ed.ci), [Fondation Orange](https://www.fondationorange.com/+-Cote-d-Ivoire-36-+) and [X'polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu).

To get my master's degree, i did an internship at [Orage C√¥te d'Ivoire](https://www.orange.ci), for six months around (June, 2020 to December 2020). I was involved in the Geomareting service to work on the subject below: Building density estimation from the satellite images. The main reason whom I decide to work on this topic was to enhance my career in the research project. With the help of people in this service, I used my knowledge in Machine learning to build segmentation and classification models. The segmentation model was to find the geometry position of the building in the images. Next, the classification models were to distinguish between an area of a dwelling and no dwelling and to give a particular economic class to each dwelling through the class of the quarter. I've worked on the satellite image of Abidjan city for the year 2015.

I also hold a bachelor's degree in mathematics and applications from [Universit√© Felix Houphouet Boigny](https://www.univ-fhb.edu.ci), Ivory Coast. I chose the field because I fell in love with mathematics since my senior school. There, I got enough knowledge in general mathematics, probability, statistics, and then in a programming language like (C, C++, Latex, Pascal, Scilab, R). I've got also some knowledge in physics like (thermodynamic, optic, mechanics).

Nowadays, I' work at my account, to prepare myself to get into a Ph.D. program.

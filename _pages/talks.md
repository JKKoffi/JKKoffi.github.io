Most of my presentations are collected in my [Speaker Deck profile](https://speakerdeck.com/carlgogo/).

## Selected talks:

### Chasing exoplanets with Python and machine learning

PySciDataGre group launch event @ UGA. I presented, to a broad and multidisciplinary audience, two Python packages for exoplanet direct imaging: VIP and SODINN. In this presentation, I emphasized how these developments were enabled by the Python open-source scientific stack, a data science interdisciplinary approach and open-source scientific software development.

### Academic Data Science: conducting research at the interface of different disciplines

Data Club @ UGA first seminar. I presented my work on image analysis and machine learning for astronomy, and the study of extra-solar planets via direct imaging. Then, I discussed the many challenges that we face as academic data scientists working at the interface of several disciplines. Finally, I concluded by listing some of the exciting opportunities that data science opens for us, young researchers, and our future (perhaps academic) careers.

### High-contrast imaging post-processing methods for exoplanet detection and characterization

Talk given at INRIA Grenoble - Rh√¥ne-Alpes. Here I presented my latests results on "Supervised detection of exoplanets in high-contrast image sequences" (see publications section).

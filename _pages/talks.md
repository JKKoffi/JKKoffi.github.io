## Exoplanet direct imaging meets data science
> Talk given at NASA ARC center and Stanford in June 2018. The slides present my Data Science approach to the problem of direct detection of exoplanets, leveraging recent developments in Machine/Deep Learning and the practices from the open-source Python community.

## Image/data processing for direct imaging of exoplanets (PyAstro2018)
> Lightning talk presented during the Python in Astronomy 2018 workshop @ Center for Computational Astrophysics, Flatiron Institute, New York. The slides present two Python packages for direct imaging of exoplanets: VIP and SODINN. VIP is an package for differential imaging and high-contrast imaging data analysis. SODINN is focused on deep learning applied to pattern recognition for detection of exoplanets in high-contrast imaging sequences.

## Exoplanet direct imaging data challenge
> Presentation given at the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science (INRIA Saclay) on the topic of data challenges for astronomical high-contrast imaging and direct detection of exoplanets.

## Data Science in astronomical image processing: looking for exoplanets using machine learning
> Talk presented at the [Data science in the Alps workshop](https://data-institute.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/news-and-events/feedback-of-the-workshop-data-science-in-the-alps--743560.htm?RH=10277933037836520). The program of this meeting was composed of a mixture of talks about methodological research and about various scientific applications of data science. The slides can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/carlgogo/data-science-in-astro-image-processing-looking-for-exoplanets-using-machine-learning).

## Chasing exoplanets with Python and machine learning
> PySciDataGre group launch event @ UGA. I presented, to a broad and multidisciplinary audience, two Python packages for exoplanet direct imaging: VIP and SODINN. In this presentation, I emphasized how these developments were enabled by the Python open-source scientific stack, a data science interdisciplinary approach and open-source scientific software development.

## Academic Data Science: conducting research at the interface of different disciplines
> Data Club @ UGA first seminar. I presented my work on image analysis and machine learning for astronomy, and the study of extra-solar planets via direct imaging. Then, I discussed the many challenges that we face as academic data scientists working at the interface of several disciplines. Finally, I concluded by listing some of the exciting opportunities that data science opens for us, young researchers, and our future (perhaps academic) careers.

## High-contrast imaging post-processing methods for exoplanet detection and characterization
> Talk given at INRIA Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes. Here I presented my latests results on "Supervised detection of exoplanets in high-contrast image sequences" (see publications section).

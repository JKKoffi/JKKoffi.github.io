# Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge
 
The [Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/
) was a community-wide effort to compare algorithms for detecting exoplanets with ground-based high-contrast imaging. I led the design and implementation of this challenge (in collaboration with several members of the high-contrast imaging community) while I worked at the Grenoble Alpes Data Institute (Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, France).

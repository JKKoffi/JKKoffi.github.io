Junior research chair in data science for Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences at the [Grenoble Alpes Data Institute](https://data-institute.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). My goal is to conduct research in interdisciplinary and open research environments, developing and applying cutting-edge techniques, and following innovative scientific workflows.

I received a PhD from the University of Liege (Belgium). My thesis project consisted in the development of open-source software packages and novel algorithmic approaches to push the detection limits of high-contrast imaging instruments. In particular, I have approached the task of exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging sequences from a supervised machine learning perspective. 

I wear several hats in my job as a research data scientist working at the interface of scientific data processing and machine learning. I spend a great deal of time developing open-source scientific computing tools and spreading the word about open research practices. The rest of the time, I am drawing inspiration from the field of artificial intelligence create innovative algorithms for multi-dimensional data processing (mostly image sequences with temporal, spectral or other additional dimensions).

_"...if the model is going to be wrong anyway, why not see if you can get the computer to ‘quickly’ learn a model from the data, rather than have a human laboriously derive a model from a lot of thought"_, Peter Norvig.

I am the junior chair in data science for Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences at the [Grenoble Alpes Data Institute](https://data-institute.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). My goal is to conduct research in interdisciplinary and open research environments, developing and applying cutting-edge techniques, and following innovative scientific workflows.

I wear several hats in my job as a research data scientist working at the interface of astronomical image/data processing and machine learning. I spend a great deal of time developing open-source scientific computing tools and spreading the word about open research practices. Also, I draw inspiration from the machine learning and artificial intelligence fields to create innovative algorithms for astronomical data processing.   

I received a PhD from the University of Liege (Belgium). During my thesis, I developed open-source software packages and novel algorithmic approaches to push the detection limits of high-contrast imaging instruments and survey campaigns. In particular, I have approached the task of exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging sequences from a supervised machine learning perspective. Take a look at my CV (or [here](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=UJBh1DUAAAAJ&hl=en)) for an updated list of publications.

_"...if the model is going to be wrong anyway, why not see if you can get the computer to ‘quickly’ learn a model from the data, rather than have a human laboriously derive a model from a lot of thought"_, Peter Norvig.

Research chair in data science for Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences at the [Grenoble Alpes Data Institute](https://data-institute.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). I received a PhD from the University of Liege (Belgium), where I worked on the development of novel algorithmic techniques for astronomical high-contrast imaging. In particular, I have approached the task of directly imaging exoplanets from a supervised deep machine learning perspective and proposed the SODINN framework for exoplanet detection. 

I wear several hats in my daily work as a research data scientist interested in interfacing scientific data processing and machine learning. On one hand, I draw inspiration from the artificial intelligence (AI) literature to create innovative algorithms for multi-dimensional data processing (e.g. image sequences with temporal, spectral or other additional dimensions). My interest in open research makes me spend a great deal of time developing open-source scientific computing tools (see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/carlgogo/)), planning [data challenges](https://carlgogo.github.io/exoimaging_challenge/) and [spreading the word about open research practices](https://grenoble-alpes-data-institute.github.io/2018-05-31-grenoble-software-carpentry/). 

Nowadays, my interest is shifting towards the application of data science and AI for the solution of some of society's biggest challenges, such as environmental sustainability and climate change.

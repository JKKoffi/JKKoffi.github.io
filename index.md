Â¡Bienvenu!
Welcome!
Bienvenido!

Here you're on my home page. I'm KOFFI Kouakou Jonathan, a 24 years old guy. I'm an enthusiastic Data Scientist & research project solver with more than 6 months working on big data projects.
TO know more about me, just, click here : [about me](https://jkkoffi.github.io/aboutme/).

Even if I'm young, I like to deal with big projects, that why I'm looking for a Ph.D. program.

I very much love my mom, aunt. Without them, i was not able to succeed at school.

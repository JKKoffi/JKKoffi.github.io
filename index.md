Research chair in data science for Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences at the [Grenoble Alpes Data Institute](https://data-institute.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). I received a PhD from the University of Liege (Belgium), where I worked on the development of novel algorithmic techniques for astronomical high-contrast imaging. In particular, I have approached the task of directly imaging exoplanets from a supervised deep learning perspective and proposed the [SODINN framework](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2018/05/aa31961-17/aa31961-17.html) for exoplanet detection. 

I wear several hats in my daily work as a research data scientist interested in interfacing scientific data processing and machine learning. On one hand, I draw inspiration from the artificial intelligence (AI) literature to create innovative algorithms for multi-dimensional data processing (e.g. image sequences with temporal, spectral or other additional dimensions). On the other hand, my interest in open research makes me spend a great deal of time developing open-source scientific computing [tools](https://github.com/carlgogo/), conducting data [challenges](https://carlgogo.github.io/exoimaging_challenge/) and spreading the word about open research [practices](https://grenoble-alpes-data-institute.github.io/2018-05-31-grenoble-software-carpentry/).

I am passionate about the development of effective solutions at the interface between Artificial Intelligence, academia and entrepreneurship for tackling humanity's biggest challenges.

I am an astronomer and data scientist working at the interface of astronomical data processing and machine learning. Following my interest in open research practices, I develop open- source scientific computing tools featuring advanced image processing and data analysis algorithms for astronomy.

I have a PhD in Astronomy from the University of Liege (Belgium) direct where I developed advanced post-processing algorithms for direct imaging of extrasolar planetary systems. Take a look at my CV for an updated list of publications.

Currently, I am the junior research chair in data science for Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences at the Grenoble Alpes Data Institute. My aim is to conduct research in cross-disciplinary environments, developing/applying cutting-edge methods and following innovative scientific workflows.

_"A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness"_, Albert Einstein.

I am an astronomer and data scientist working at the interface of astronomical data processing and machine learning. Following my interest in open research practices, I develop open-source scientific computing tools featuring advanced image processing and data analysis algorithms for astronomy.

I have a PhD in Astronomy from the University of Liege (Belgium) where I developed novel post-processing algorithms for direct imaging of extrasolar planetary systems. The aim of my thesis was to push the detection limits of high-contrast imaging instruments and survey campaigns by developing open-source software packages and novel algorithmic approaches. In particular, I've approached the task of exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging sequences from a machine learning perspective. Take a look at my CV (or [here](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=UJBh1DUAAAAJ&hl=en)) for an updated list of publications.

Currently, I'm the junior research chair in data science for Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences at the [Grenoble Alpes Data Institute](https://data-institute.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). My aim is to conduct research in cross-disciplinary environments, developing/applying cutting-edge methods and following innovative scientific workflows.
